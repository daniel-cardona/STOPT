STOPT is a C++ library that presents a robot trajectory optimization formulation that builds upon numerical optimal control and Lie group methods. In particular, this solver uses trapezoidal collocation and exploits the inherent sparsity of this method and the efficiency of geometric algorithms based on Lie algebras to dramatically reduce the number of floating-point operations to get the first-order information of the problem.

In order to demonstrate the scalability of this formulation three examples are build within the library, each one demonstrate the efficiency with different articulated robots such as a finger, a mobile manipulator and a humanoid, composed of five, eight and more than twenty degrees of freedom respectively.
